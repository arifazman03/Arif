# Donation Form Interaction 
This repository contains a simple JavaScript interaction for a donation form on a website. The interaction is designed to provide feedback to the user based on the validity of the form submission.

## Interaction Overview
The JavaScript code included is responsible for handling the form submission. It listens for a click event on the submit button (`#submitButton`) and checks if the form (`#form`) is valid using the `checkValidity()` method.

If the form is valid, the user receives a "Thank you for donating!!!" alert. If the form is not valid (some required fields are not filled), an "Error!!! Fill in the forms to donate." alert is displayed.

## Usage
To integrate this donation form interaction, follow these steps:

1. Include the JavaScript file in your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="path/to/donation-form-interaction.js"></script>

2. Ensure your form and submit button have the specified IDs:

   ```html
   <form id="form">
      <!-- Your form fields go here -->
      <button type="button" id="submitButton">Submit</button>
   </form>

3. Customize the alerts or further actions based on requirements.

   ```js
   var form = document.getElementById('form');
   var submitButton = document.getElementById('submitButton');

   submitButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
   // Check if the form is valid
       if (form.checkValidity()) {
         alert('Thank you for donating!!!');
       } else {
         alert('Error!!! Fill in the forms to donate.');
       }
    });

## Clone the repository and include the JavaScript file in your project:
